This is the repo for my final year project, Ethics of Monetisation in Digital Games. 

The prototype produced as part of the project can be accessed by downloading the APK from my personal Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14CDfvt5a0p9ZcSqMT2NLE7CW4d-QGNfM/view?usp=sharing

The dissertation itself is a Word .docx file in the repo.
